We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')"

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful represen-\\ntations of sequences or sets of data-points [Vaswani et al., 2017].

These can\\nbe collected together into an array X(0).\\n1 Strictly speaking, the collection of tokens does\\nnot need to have an order and the transformer\\ncan handle them as a set (where order does not\\nmatter), rather than a sequence. See section 3.\\n2 Note that much of the literature uses the trans-\\nposed notation whereby the data matrix is N×D,\\nbut I want sequences to run across the page and\\nfeatures down it in the schematics (a convention\\nI use in other lecture notes).\\nFigure 2: Encoding an image: an example [Doso-\\nvitskiy et al., 2021].\\nAn image is split into N\\npatches. Each patch is reshaped into a vector by\\nthe vec operator. This vector is acted upon by a\\nmatrix W which maps the patch to a D dimen-\\nsional vector x(0)\\nn . These vectors are collected\\ntogether into the input X(0).\\nThe matrix W\\ncan be learned with the rest of the transformer’s\\nparameters.\\n3 The idea of interleaving processing across the\\nsequence and across features is a common motif\\nof many machine learning architectures includ-\\ning graph neural networks (interleaves processing\\nacross nodes and across features), Fourier neu-\\nral operators (interleaves processing across space\\nand across features), and bottleneck blocks in\\nResNets (interleaves processing across pixels and\\nacross features).\\n1\\nPreliminaries\\nLet’s start by talking about the form of the data that is input into a transformer,\\nthe goal of the transformer, and the form of its output.\\n1.1\\nInput data format: sets or sequences of tokens\\nIn order to apply a transformer, data must be converted into a set or sequence1\\nof N tokens x(0)\\nn\\nof dimension D (see figure 1). The tokens can be collected\\ninto a matrix X(0) which is D × N.2 To give two concrete examples\\n1. a passage of text can be broken up into a sequence of words or sub-words,\\nwith each word being represented by a single unique vector,\\n2. an image can be broken up into a set of patches and each patch can be\\nmapped into a vector.\\nThe embeddings can be fixed or they can be learned with the rest of the pa-\\nrameters of the model e.g. the vectors representing words can be optimised or\\na learned linear transform can be used to embed image patches (see figure 2).\\nA sequence of tokens is a generic representation to use as an input – many\\ndifferent types of data can be “tokenised” and transformers are then immediately\\napplicable rather than requiring a bespoke architectures for each modality as\\nwas previously the case (CNNs for images, RNNs for sequences, deepsets for\\nsets etc.).\\nMoreover, this means that you don’t need bespoke handcrafted\\narchitectures for mixing data of different modalities — you can just throw them\\nall into a big set of tokens.\\n1.2\\nGoal: representations of sequences\\nThe transformer will ingest the input data X(0) and return a representation of\\nthe sequence in terms of another matrix X(M) which is also of size D × N.\\nThe slice xn = X(M)\\n:,n\\nwill be a vector of features representing the sequence at\\nthe location of token n. These representations can be used for auto-regressive\\nprediction of the next (n+1)th token, global classification of the entire sequence\\n(by pooling across the whole representation), sequence-to-sequence or image-\\nto-image prediction problems, etc. Here M denotes the number of layers in the\\ntransformer.\\n2\\nThe transformer block\\nThe representation of the input sequence will be produced by iteratively applying\\na transformer block\\nX(m) = transformer-block(X(m−1)).\\nThe block itself comprises two stages: one operating across the sequence and one\\noperating across the features. The first stage refines each feature independently\\naccording to relationships between tokens across the sequence e.g. how much\\na word in a sequence at position n depends on previous words at position n′,\\nor how much two different patches from an image are related to one another.\\nThis stage acts horizontally across rows of X(m−1). The second stage refines\\nthe features representing each token. This stage acts vertically across a column\\nof X(m−1). By repeatedly applying the transformer block the representation at\\ntoken n and feature d can be shaped by information at token n′ and feature d′.3\\n1\\n4 Relationship to Convolutional Neural Net-\\nworks (CNNs).\\nThe attention mechanism can\\nrecover convolutional filtering as a special case\\ne.g. if x(0)\\nn\\nis a 1D regularly sampled time-series\\nand A(m)\\nn′,n = A(m)\\nn′−n then the attention mecha-\\nnism in eq. 1 becomes a convolution. Unlike nor-\\nmal CNNs, these filters have full temporal sup-\\nport. Later we will see that the filters themselves\\ndynamically depend on the input, another differ-\\nence from standard CNNs.\\nWe will also see a\\nsimilarity: transformers will use multiple atten-\\ntion maps in each layer in the same way that\\nCNNs use multiple filters (though typically trans-\\nformers have fewer attention maps than CNNs\\nhave channels).\\n5 The need for transformers to store and com-\\npute N ×N attention arrays can be a major com-\\nputational bottleneck, which makes processing of\\nlong sequences challenging.\\n6 When training transformers to perform auto-\\nregressive prediction, e.g. predicting the next\\nword in a sequence based on the previous ones, a\\nclever modification to the model can be used to\\naccelerate training and inference. This involves\\napplying the transformer to the whole sequence,\\nand using masking in the attention mechanism\\n(A(m) becomes an upper triangular matrix) to\\nprevent future tokens affecting the representation\\nat earlier tokens. Causal predictions can then be\\nmade for the entire sequence in one forward pass\\nthrough the transformer. See section 4 for more\\ninformation.\\n7 We temporarily suppress the superscripts here\\nto ease the notation so A(m)\\nn,n′ becomes An,n′\\nand similarly x(m)\\nn\\nbecomes xn.\\n2.1\\nStage 1: self-attention across the sequence\\nThe output of the first stage of the transformer block is another D × N array,\\nY (m). The output is produced by aggregating information across the sequence\\nindependently for each feature using an operation called attention.\\nAttention. Specifically, the output vector at location n, denoted y(m)\\nn\\n, is pro-\\nduced by a simple weighted average of the input features at location n′ =\\n1 . . . N, denoted x(m−1)\\nn′\\n, that is4\\ny(m)\\nn\\n=\\nN\\nX\\nn′=1\\nx(m−1)\\nn′\\nA(m)\\nn′,n.\\n(1)\\nHere the weighting is given by a so-called attention matrix A(m)\\nn′,n which is of\\nsize5 N × N and normalises over its columns PN\\nn′=1 A(m)\\nn′,n = 1. Intuitively\\nspeaking A(m)\\nn′,n will take a high value for locations in the sequence n′ which are\\nof high relevance for location n. For irrelevant locations, it will take the value\\n0. For example, all patches of a visual scene coming from a single object might\\nhave high corresponding attention values.\\nWe can compactly write the relationship as a matrix multiplication,\\nY (m) = X(m−1)A(m),\\n(2)\\nand we illustrate it below in figure 3.6\\nFigure 3: The output of an element of the attention mechanism, Y (m)\\nd,n , is\\nproduced by the dot product of the input horizontally sliced through time X(m)\\nd,:\\nwith a vertical slice from the attention matrix A(m)\\n:,n . Here the shading in the\\nattention matrix represent the elements with a high value in white and those\\nwith a low value, near to 0, in black.\\nSelf-attention. So far, so simple. But where does the attention matrix come\\nfrom? The neat idea in the first stage of the transformer is that the attention\\nmatrix is generated from the input sequence itself – so-called self-attention.\\nA simple way of generating the attention matrix from the input would be to\\nmeasure the similarity between two locations by the dot product between the\\nfeatures at those two locations and then use a softmax function to handle the\\nnormalisation i.e.7\\nAn,n′ =\\nexp(x⊤\\nn xn′)\\nPN\\nn′′=1 exp(x⊤\\nn′′xn′)\\n.\\n2\\n8 Often you will see attention parameterised as\\nAn,n′ =\\nexp(x⊤\\nn U⊤Uxn′/\\n√\\nD)\\nPN\\nn′′=1 exp(x⊤\\nn′′U⊤Uxn′/\\n√\\nD)\\n.\\nDividing the exponents by the square-root of the\\ndimensionality of the projected vector helps nu-\\nmerical stability, but in this presentation we ab-\\nsorb this term into U to improve clarity.\\n9 Some of this effect could be handled by the\\nnormalisation in the denominator, but asymmet-\\nric similarity allows more flexibility. However, I\\ndo not know of experimental evidence to support\\nusing Uq ̸= Uk.\\n10\\nRelationship\\nto\\nRecurrent\\nNeural\\nNet-\\nworks (RNNs).\\nIt is illuminating to compare\\nthe temporal processing in the transformer to\\nthat of RNNs which recursively update a hid-\\nden state feature representation (x(1)\\nn ) based\\non the current observation (x(0)\\nn ) and the pre-\\nvious hidden state x(1)\\nn\\n= f(x(1)\\nn−1; x(0)\\nn ) =\\nf(f(x(1)\\nn−2; x(0)\\nn−1); x(0)\\nn ).\\nHere we’ve unrolled\\nthe RNN one step to show that observations\\nwhich are nearby to the hidden state (e.g. x(0)\\nn )\\nare treated differently from observations that\\nare further away (e.g. x(0)\\nn−1), as information is\\npropagated by recurrent application of the func-\\ntion f(·). In contrast, in the transformer, self-\\nattention treats all observations at all time-points\\nin an identical manner, no matter how far away\\nthey are.\\nThis is one reason why they find it\\nsimpler to learn long-range relationships.\\n11 If attention matrices are viewed as a data-\\ndriven version of filters in a CNN, then the need\\nfor more filters / channels is clear.\\nTypical\\nchoices for the number of heads H is 8 or 16,\\nlower than typical numbers of channels in a CNN.\\n12 The computational cost of multi-head self-\\nattention is usually dominated by the matrix mul-\\ntiplication involving the attention matrix and is\\ntherefore O(HDN2).\\n13 The product of the matrices V (m)\\nh\\nX(m−1)\\nis related to the so-called values which are nor-\\nmally introduced in descriptions of self-attention\\nalong side queries and keys. In the usual presen-\\ntation, there is a redundancy between the linear\\ntransform used to compute the values and the lin-\\near projection at the end of the multi-head self-\\nattention, so we have not explicitly introduced\\nthem here. The standard presentation can be re-\\ncovered by setting Vh to be a low-rank matrix\\nVh = UhUv,h where Uh is DxK and Uv,h is\\nKxD. Typically K is set to K = D/H so that\\nchanging the number of heads leads to models\\nwith similar numbers of parameters and compu-\\ntational demands.\\nHowever, this naïve approach entangles information about the similarity between\\nlocations in the sequence with the content of the sequence itself.\\nAn alternative is to perform the same operation on a linear transformation of\\nthe sequence, Uxn, so that8\\nAn,n′ =\\nexp(x⊤\\nn U ⊤Uxn′)\\nPN\\nn′′=1 exp(x⊤\\nn′′U ⊤Uxn′)\\nTypically, U will project to a lower dimensional space i.e. U is K×D dimensional\\nwith K < D. In this way only some of the features in the input sequence need\\nbe used to compute the similarity, the others being projected out, thereby de-\\ncoupling the attention computation from the content. However, the numerator\\nin this construction is symmetric. This could be a disadvantage. For example,\\nwe might want the word ‘caulking iron’ to be strongly associated with the word\\n‘tool’ (as it is a type of tool), but have the word ‘tool’ more weakly associated\\nwith the word ‘caulking iron’ (because most of us rarely encounter it).9\\nFortunately, it is simple to generalise the attention mechanism above to be asym-\\nmetric by applying two different linear transformations to the original sequence,\\nAn,n′ =\\nexp\\n\\x00x⊤\\nn U ⊤\\nk Uqxn′\\x01\\nPN\\nn′′=1 exp\\n\\x00x⊤\\nn′′U ⊤\\nk Uqxn′\\x01.\\n(3)\\nThe two quantities that are dot-producted together here qn = Uqxn and kn =\\nUkxn are typically known as the queries and the keys, respectively.\\nTogether equations 2 and 3 define the self-attention mechanism. Notice that\\nthe K × D matrices Uq and Uk are the only parameters of this mechanism.10\\nMulti-head self-attention (MHSA). In the self-attention mechanisms de-\\nscribed above, there is one attention matrix which describes the similarity of\\ntwo locations within the sequence. This can act as a bottleneck in the architec-\\nture – it would be useful for pairs of points to be similar in some ‘dimensions’\\nand different in others.11\\nIn order to increase capacity of the first self-attention stage, the transformer\\nblock applies H sets of self-attention in parallel12 (termed H heads) and then\\nlinearly projects the results down to the D × N array required for further pro-\\ncessing. This slight generalisation is called multi-head self-attention.\\nY (m) = MHSAθ(X(m−1)) =\\nH\\nX\\nh=1\\nV (m)\\nh\\nX(m−1)A(m)\\nh\\n, where\\n(4)\\n[A(m)\\nh\\n]n,n′ =\\nexp\\n\\x12\\x10\\nk(m)\\nh,n\\n\\x11⊤\\nq(m)\\nh,n′\\n\\x13\\nPN\\nn′′=1 exp\\n\\x12\\x10\\nk(m)\\nh,n′′\\n\\x11⊤\\nq(m)\\nh,n′\\n\\x13\\n(5)\\nq(m)\\nh,n = U (m)\\nq,h x(m−1)\\nn\\nand k(m)\\nh,n = U (m)\\nk,h x(m−1)\\nn\\n.\\n(6)\\nHere the H matrices V (m)\\nh\\nwhich are D × D project the H self-attention stages\\ndown to the required output dimensionality D.13\\nThe addition of the matrices V (m)\\nh\\n, and the fact that retaining just the diagonal\\nelements of the attention matrix A(m) will interact the signal instantaneously\\nwith itself, does mean there is some cross-feature processing in multi-head self-\\nattention, as opposed to it containing purely cross-sequence processing. How-\\never, the stage has limited capacity for this type of processing and it is the job\\nof the second stage to address this.\\n3\\n14 The MLPs used typically have one or two\\nhidden-layers with dimension equal to the num-\\nber of features D (or larger). The computational\\ncost of this step is therefore roughly N×D×D. If\\nthe feature embedding size approaches the length\\nof the sequence D ≈N, the MLPs can start to\\ndominate the computational complexity (e.g. this\\ncan be the case for vision transformers which em-\\nbed large patches).\\n15\\nRelationship to Graph Neural Networks\\n(GNNs). At a high level, graph neural networks\\ninterleave two steps.\\nFirst, a message passing\\nstep where each node receives messages from its\\nneighbours which are then aggregated together.\\nSecond, a feature processing step where the in-\\ncoming aggregated messages are used to update\\neach node’s features.\\nThrough this lens, the\\ntransformer can be viewed as an unrolled GNN\\nwith each token corresponding to an edge of a\\nfully connected graph.\\nMHSA forms the mes-\\nsage passing step, and the MLPs forming the\\nfeature update step. Each transformer block cor-\\nresponds to one update of the GNN. Moreover,\\nmany methods for scaling transformers introduce\\nsparse forms of attention where each token at-\\ntends to only a restricted set of other tokens,\\nthat is they specify a sparse graph connectivity\\nstructure. Arguably, in this way transformers are\\nmore general as they can use different graphs at\\ndifferent layers in the transformer.\\n16 This is also known as z-scoring in some fields\\nand is related to whitening.\\nFigure 4 shows multi-head self-attention schematically. Multi-head attention\\ncomprises the following parameters θ = {Uq,h, Uk,h, Vh}H\\nh=1 i.e. 3H matrices\\nof size K × D, K × D, and D × D respectively.\\nFigure 4: Multi-head self-attention applies H self-\\nattention operations in parallel and then linearly\\nprojects the HD × N dimensional output down to\\nD ×N by applying a linear transform, implemented\\nhere by the H matrices Vh.\\n2.2\\nStage 2: multi-layer perceptron across features\\nThe second stage of processing in the transformer block operates across features,\\nrefining the representation using a non-linear transform. To do this, we simply\\napply a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to the vector of features at each location\\nn in the sequence,\\nx(m)\\nn\\n= MLPθ(y(m)\\nn\\n).\\nNotice that the parameters of the MLP, θ, are the same for each location n.14\\n15\\n2.3\\nThe transformer block: Putting it all together with residual con-\\nnections and layer normalisation\\nWe can now stack MHSA and MLP layers to produce the transformer block.\\nRather than doing this directly, we make use of two ubiquitous transformations\\nto produce a more stable model that trains more easily: residual connections\\nand normalisation.\\nResidual connections. The use of residual connections is widespread across\\nmachine learning as they make initialisation simple, have a sensible inductive bias\\ntowards simple functions, and stabilise learning [Szegedy et al., 2017]. Instead\\nof directly specifying a function x(m) = fθ(x(m−1)), the idea is to parameterise\\nit in terms of an identity mapping and a residual term\\nx(m) = x(m−1) + resθ(x(m−1)).\\nEquivalently, this can be viewed as modelling the differences between the repre-\\nsentation x(m) −x(m−1) = resθ(x(m−1)) and will work well when the function\\nthat is being modelled is close to identity. This type of parameterisation is used\\nfor both the MHSA and MLP stages in the transformer, with the idea that each\\napplies a mild non-linear transformation to the representation. Over many layers,\\nthese mild non-linear transformations compose to form large transformations.\\nToken normalisation. The use of normalisation, such as LayerNorm and Batch-\\nNorm, is also widespread across the deep learning community as a means to\\nstabilise learning. There are many potential choices for how to compute nor-\\nmalisation statistics (see figure 5 for a discussion), but the standard approach\\nis use LayerNorm [Ba et al., 2016] which normalises each token separately, re-\\nmoving the mean and dividing by the standard deviation,16\\n¯xd,n =\\n1\\np\\nvar(xn)\\n(xd,n −mean(xn)) γd + βd = LayerNorm(X)d,n\\nwhere mean(xn) = 1\\nD\\nPD\\nd=1 xd,n and var(xn) = 1\\nD\\nPD\\nd=1(xd,n −mean(xn))2.\\nThe two parameters γd and βd are a learned scale and shift.\\n4\\nbatch\\nfeature\\nsequence\\nd=D\\nd=1\\nn=N\\nn=1\\nbatch\\nfeature\\nsequence\\nd=D\\nd=1\\nn=N\\nn=1\\nLayerNorm for transformers\\n(TokenNorm)\\nBatchNorm for transformers\\nFigure 5:\\nTransformers perform layer normali-\\nsation (left hand schematic) which normalises the\\nmean and standard deviation of each individual to-\\nken in each sequence in the batch. Batch normal-\\nisation (right hand schematic), which normalises\\nover the feature and batch dimension together, is\\nfound to be far less stable [Shen et al., 2020].\\nOther flavours of normalisation are possible and po-\\ntentially under-explored e.g. instance normalisation\\nwould normalise across the sequence dimension in-\\nstead.\\n17\\nWhilst it is possible to control the non-\\nlinearities and weights in neural networks to pre-\\nvent explosion of the representation, the con-\\nstraints this places on the activation functions\\ncan adversely affect learning.\\nThe LayerNorm\\napproach is arguably simpler and simpler to train.\\nbatch\\nfeature\\nimage height\\nand width\\nd=D\\nd=1\\nbatch\\nfeature\\nsequence\\nd=D\\nd=1\\nn=N\\nn=1\\nLayerNorm for CNNs\\nBatchNorm for CNNs\\nFigure 6: In CNNs LayerNorm is conventionally\\napplied to both the features and across the fea-\\nture maps (i.e. across the height and width of the\\nimages) (left hand schematic). As the height and\\nwidth dimension in CNNs corresponds to the se-\\nquence dimension, 1 . . . N of transformers, the\\nterm ’LayerNorm’ is arguably used inconsistently\\n(compare to figure 5). I would prefer to call the\\nnormalisation used in transformers ’token nor-\\nmalisation’ instead to avoid confusion.\\nBatch\\nnormalisation (right hand schematic) is consis-\\ntently defined.\\n18 The exact configuration of the normalisation\\nand residual layers can differ, but here we show\\na standard setup [Xiong et al., 2020].\\nAs this transform normalises each token individually and as LayerNorm is ap-\\nplied differently in CNNs, see figure 6, I would prefer to call this normalisation\\nTokenNorm.\\nThis transform stops feature representations blowing up in magnitude as non-\\nlinearities are repeatedly applied through neural networks.17\\nIn transformers,\\nLayerNorm is usually applied in the residual terms of both the MHSA and MLP\\nstages.\\nPutting this all together, we have the standard transformer block shown schemat-\\nically in figure 7.18\\nFigure 7: The transformer block. Residual connections are added to the multi-\\nhead self-attention (MHSA) stage and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) stage.\\nLayer normalisation is also applied to the inputs of both the MHSA and the\\nMLP. They are then stacked. This block can then be repeated M times.\\n3\\nPosition encoding\\nThe transformer treats the data as a set — if you permute the columns of X(0)\\n(i.e. re-order the tokens in the input sequence) you permute all the represen-\\ntations throughout the network X(m) in the same way. This is key for many\\napplications since there may not be a natural way to order the original data into\\na sequence of tokens. For example, there is no single ‘correct’ order to map\\n5\\n19 Vision transformers [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]\\nuse x(0)\\nn\\n= Wpn + en where pn is the nth\\nvectorised patch, en is the learned position em-\\nbedding, and W is the patch embedding matrix.\\nArguably it would be more intuitive to append\\nthe position embedding to the patch embedding.\\nHowever, if we use the concatenation approach\\nand consider what happens after applying a linear\\ntransform,\\nV\\nh Wpn\\nen\\ni\\n=\\nh V11\\nV12\\nV21\\nV22\\nih Wpn\\nen\\ni\\n=\\nh V11Wpn + V12en\\nV21Wpn + V22en\\ni\\n= W ′pn + e′\\nn\\nwe recover the additive construction, which is\\none hint as to why the additive construction\\nworks.\\n20 Note that I’m overloading the notation here:\\npreviously superscripts denoted layers in the\\ntransformer, but here I’m using them to denote\\nthe number of items in the input sequence.\\nimage patches into a one dimensional sequence.\\nHowever, this presents a problem since positional information is key in many\\nproblems and the transformer has thrown it out.\\nThe sequence ‘herbivores\\neat plants’ should not have the same representation (up to permutation) as\\n‘plants eat herbivores’. Nor should an image have the same representation as\\none comprising the same patches randomly permuted. Thankfully, there is a\\nsimple fix for this: the location of each token within the original dataset should\\nbe included in the token itself, or through the way it is processed. There are\\nseveral options how to do this, one is to include this information directly into the\\nembedding X(0). E.g. by simply adding the position embedding (surprisingly this\\nworks19) or concatenating. The position information can be fixed e.g. adding a\\nvector of sinusoids of different frequencies and phases to encode position of a\\nword in a sentence [Vaswani et al., 2017], or it can be a free parameter which is\\nlearned [Devlin et al., 2019], as it often done in image transformers. There are\\nalso approaches to include relative distance information between pairs of tokens\\nby modifying the self-attention mechanism [Wu et al., 2021] which connects to\\nequivariant transformers.\\n4\\nApplication specific transformer variants\\nFor completeness we will give some simple examples for how the standard trans-\\nformer architecture above is used and modified for specific applications. This\\nincludes adding a head to the transformer blocks to carry out the desired pre-\\ndiction task, but also modifications to the standard construction of the body.\\n4.1\\nAuto-regressive language modelling\\nIn auto-regressive language modelling the goal is to predict the next word wn\\nin the sequence given the previous words w1:n−1, that is to return p(wn =\\nw|w1:n−1). Two modifications are required to use the transformer for this task\\n— a change to the body to make the architecture efficient and the addition of\\na head to make the predictions for the next word.\\nModification to the body: auto-regressive masking. Applying the version\\nof the transformer we have covered so far to auto-regressive prediction is compu-\\ntationally expensive, both during training and testing. To see this, note that AR\\nprediction requires making a sequence of predictions: you start by predicting the\\nfirst word p(w1 = w), then you predict the second given the first p(w2 = w|w1),\\nthen the third word given the first two p(w2 = w|w1, w2), and so on until you\\npredict the last item in the sequence p(wN = w|w1:N−1). This requires apply-\\ning the transformer N −1 times with input sequences that grow by one word\\neach time: w1, w1:2, . . . , w1:N−1. This is very costly at both training-time and\\ntest-time.\\nFortunately, there is a neat way around this by enabling the transformer to\\nsupport incremental updates whereby if you add a new token to an existing\\nsequence, you do not change the representation for the old tokens. To make this\\nproperty clear, I will define it mathematically: let the output of the incremental\\ntransformer applied to the first n words be denoted20\\nX(n) = transformer-incremental(w1:n).\\nThen the output of the incremental transformer when applied to n + 1 words is\\nX(n+1) = transformer-incremental(w1:n+1).\\nIn the incremental transformer X(n) = X(n+1)\\n1:D,1:n i.e. the representation of the\\nold tokens has not changed by adding the new one. If we have this property\\n6\\n21 Notice that this masking operation also en-\\ncodes position information since you can infer\\nthe order of the tokens from the mask.\\n22 This restriction to the attention will cause a\\nloss of representational power. It’s an open ques-\\ntion as to how significant this is and whether in-\\ncreasing the capacity of the model can mitigate\\nit e.g. by using higher dimensional tokens, i.e. in-\\ncreasing D.\\nthen 1. at test-time auto-regressive generation can use incremental updates to\\ncompute the new representation efficiently, 2. at training time we can make\\nthe N auto-regressive predictions for the whole sequence p(w1 = w)p(w2 =\\nw|w1)p(w2 = w|w1, w2) . . . p(wN = w|w1:N−1) in a single forwards pass.\\nUnfortunately, the standard transformer introduced above does not have this\\nproperty due to the form of the attention used. Every token attends to every\\nother token, so if we add a new token to the sequence then the representation\\nfor every token changes throughout the transformer. However, if we mask the\\nattention matrix so that it is upper-triangular An,n′ = 0 when n > n′ then\\nthe representation of each word only depends on the previous words.21 This\\nthen gives us the incremental property as none of the other operations in the\\ntransformer operate across the sequence.22\\nAdding a head. We’re now almost set to perform auto-regressive language\\nmodelling. We apply the masked transformer block M times to the input se-\\nquence of words. We then take the representation at token n −1, that is x(M)\\nn−1\\nwhich captures causal information in the sequence at this point, and generate\\nthe probability of the next word through a softmax operation\\np(wn = w|w1:n−1) = p(wn = w|x(M)\\nn−1) =\\nexp(g⊤\\nwx(M)\\nn−1)\\nPW\\nw=1 exp(g⊤\\nwx(M)\\nn−1)\\n.\\nHere W is the vocabulary size, the wth word is w and {gw}W\\nw=1 are softmax\\nweights that will be learned.\\n4.2\\nImage classification\\nFor image classification the goal is to predict the label y given the input image\\nwhich has been tokenised into the sequence X(0), that is p(y|X(0)). One way\\nof computing this distribution would be to apply the standard transformer body\\nM times to the tokenised image patches before aggregating the final layer of the\\ntransformer, X(M), across the sequence e.g. by spatial pooling h = PN\\nn=1 x(M)\\nn\\nin order to form a feature representation for the entire image. The representation\\nh could then be used to perform softmax classification. An alternative approach\\nis found to perform better [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Instead we introduce a\\nnew fixed (learned) token at the start n = 0 of the input sequence x(0)\\n0 . At\\nthe head we use the n = 0 vector, x(M)\\n0\\n, to perform the softmax classification.\\nThis approach has the advantage that the transformer maintains and refines a\\nglobal representation of the sequence at each layer m of the transformer that is\\nappropriate for classification.\\n4.3\\nMore complex uses\\nThe transformer block can also be used as part of more complicated systems\\ne.g. in encoder-decoder architectures for sequence-to-sequence modelling for\\ntranslation [Devlin et al., 2019, Vaswani et al., 2017] or in masked auto-encoders\\nfor self-supervised vision systems [He et al., 2021].\\n5\\nConclusion\\nThis concludes this basic introduction to transformers which aspired to be math-\\nematically precise and to provide intuitions behind the design decisions.\\nWe have not talked about loss functions or training in any detail, but this is\\nbecause rather standard deep learning approaches are used for these. Briefly,\\n7\\ntransformers are typically trained using the Adam optimiser. They are often\\nslow to train compared to other architectures and typically get more unstable\\nas training progresses. Gradient clipping, decaying learning rate schedules, and\\nincreasing batch sizes through training help to mitigate these instabilities, but\\noften they still persist.\\nAcknowledgements.

An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were considered. Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.\\nChelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in its early years. The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point. Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons including 1907–08, 1909–10, 1911–12, 1912–13, 1913–14 and 1919–20. They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.\\n\\n\\n=== Modernisation and the first league championship (1952–1983) ===\\n\\nFormer Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.\\nDocherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up, and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late \"),\n",

Under the management of John Martin, they beat Millwall Lionesses to win the 1974 London Women's Football Challenge Cup in a season when they did a league and cup double. They repeated the feat the following season. Although more of a supporters team rather than an official representative of Chelsea F.C., the club's president at the time was John Hollins, who was a long-time Chelsea player.\\n\\n\\n=== Establishment and promotion (1992–2005) ===\\nChelsea Ladies Football Club was formed in 1992 after supporters of Chelsea F.C. expressed desire for a women's side. Tony Farmer, a longtime Chelsea supporter who became interested in women's football when his girlfriend Val Lightfoot joined Crystal Palace, wrote a letter to Chelsea F.C. to propose adding a women's side.\\nUpon approval, Farmer became the club's first manager, lobbied for it to be promoted in men's match programmes, and began recruiting youth players to the club, including Casey Stoney and Fara Williams as 12-year-olds in 1994 and 1996, respectively. The side's first home pitch was Hurlingham Park in Fulham. Farmer managed the club from the Greater London Regional League Division 3 to the Greater London Regional Premier Division before resigning in 1997.\\nIn June 2004, Chelsea Ladies were taken over and funded by Chelsea's Football in the Community department, and in 2004–05 Chelsea won promotion to the Premier League National Division. The club has participated at the top level ever since.\\n\\n\\n=== FA Premier League National Division (2005–2010) ===\\nAfter starting 2005–06 with one point from six games, manager George Michealas was fired in September after four years in charge. They finished bottom of the league that season under Shaun Gore, but won a promotion/relegation play-off against Northern Division runners-up Liverpool 4–1 on aggregate to stay in the Premier League National Division. During the season the club had been linked with a transfer bid for North American star players Tiffeny Milbrett and Christine Sinclair.\\nAfter an eighth-place finish in 2006–07, Gore drafted in England players Siobhan Chamberlain, Casey Stoney and Eniola Aluko that summer. American World Cup winner Lorrie Fair, regarded as one of the best midfielders in the women's game, joined in January as Chelsea finished 2007–08 in fifth position.\\nChelsea Ladies introduced a new manager for the 2008–09 season, former Arsenal Ladies reserve team coach Steve Jones. On 2 July 2008 Chelsea surprisingly signed Lianne Sanderson and Anita Asante from Arsenal Ladies, in addition to veteran Mary Phillip. Then Arsenal Ladies manager Vic Akers criticised his former players as disrespectful\"),\n",

The game was marred by a fracas involving Frank Lampard, Cesc Fàbregas and others that resulted in yellow cards for the two and three other players sent off, the dismissal of Emmanuel Adebayor and incidents of Chelsea fans throwing celery at Arsenal players. This led the media to dub it the \"Snarling Cup final\".
